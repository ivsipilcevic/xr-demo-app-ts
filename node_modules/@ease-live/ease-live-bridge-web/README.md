# Ease Live Bridge for HTML5

## Overview

This library allows you as a web developer to integrate Ease Live with your chosen video streaming player on your web site.

## Documentation

See [docs](docs) folder.

## Development

1. Build your library
  * Run `npm install` to get the project's dependencies
  * Run `npm run build` to produce minified umd version of your library.
2. Development mode
  * Having all the dependencies installed run `npm run dev`. This command will generate an non-minified version of your library and will run a watcher so you get the compilation on file change. The example folder will be available using `webpack-dev-server`, at http://localhost:8080/.
3. Running the tests
  * Run `npm run test`

## Scripts

* `npm run build` - produces production version of your library under the `dist` folder
* `npm run build:es` - produces production version of your library under the `es` folder, for usage with npm
* `npm run build:examples` - builds the examples web app under the `build` folder
* `npm run dev` - produces development version of your library and runs a webpack dev server with watcher
* `npm run test` - well ... it runs the tests :)
* `npm run test:watch` - same as above but in a watch mode
* `npm run release` - release a new version (see [RELEASING.md](./RELEASING.md))

## Credits

* Webpack 3 based.
* ES6 as a source.
* Exports in a [umd](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) format so your library works everywhere.
* ES6 test setup with [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/) and [Chai](http://chaijs.com/).
